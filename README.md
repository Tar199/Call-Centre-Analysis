# Call-Centre-Analysis
* Data transformation and reporting: Transform raw data and create custom metrics for key indicators such as "Answer" and "Resolves." Visualizations were created using the power of BI, including a donut chart showing 4,054 answered calls and 946 missed calls, and a metric chart with a customer satisfaction score of 3.40/5.0.
* Key Performance Indicators (KPI): Customer Satisfaction Index, Call Management, and Customer Service. Check metrics like average response speed of 67.52 seconds on 1,354 calls out of 5,000 calls to monitor and improve call center performance.
* Features and Interactions: Internal filters and sliders for complex data processing. Patches provide a comprehensive view of call center operations, enabling managers to identify performance trends, improve resolution, and improve customer service
